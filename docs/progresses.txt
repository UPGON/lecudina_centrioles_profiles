Data description:

The values are line scans (1um) across expanded centrioles (for each image 3 measurements in centriole and 3 measurements in axoneme).

Problem:

The problem is that the pixel size/ magnification/ expansion was different between different images.
Hence, 1um length has a variable number of pixels.

Assumptions
technical: the values are originally uint16, therefore, decimal values result from the averaging and can be rounded to be processed with opencv

Goal:
After interpolation, we would like to have all measurements with the same number of data points (that is 112 data points).

Q: why 112 points and not 100?
Q: is the picture name id relevant?
In a next step we would like to average/ align the peak maxima for basal body or axoneme (to be seen if this is meaningful- maybe the data is too noisy and all peaks are lost by averaging?).

Expected outcome:

1) we are sure to have a wider peak for basal body than axoneme. (FWHM), for this averaging will work.
2) We think (but are less sure)  that we may have 4 peaks in basal body and only 3 peaks in axoneme.

But maybe the peak-peak distance is too variable.
Do you have other suggestions how to show this convincingly?


Best,
