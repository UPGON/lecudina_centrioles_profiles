Initial steps

Hi LÃ©o,

here is the excel table attached.

The values are line scans (1um) across expanded centrioles (for each image 3 measurements in centriole and 3 measurements in axoneme).
The problem is that the pixel size/ magnification/ expansion was different between different images.
Hence 1um length has more or less number of pixels.

After interpolation we would like to have all measurements with the same number of datapoints (that is 112 datapoints).
In a next step we would like to average/ align  the peak maxima for basal body or axoneme (to be seen if this is meaningful- maybe the data is too noisy and all peaks are lost by averaging?).

Expected outcome:
1) we are sure to have a wider peak for basal body than axoneme. (FWHM), for this averaging will work.
2) We think (but are less sure)  that we may have 4 peaks in basal body and only 3 peaks in axoneme.
But maybe the peak-peak distance is too variable. Do you have other suggestions how to show this convincingly?

As mentioned, maybe you want to chat about that after your (and my) vacation.

best,
Alexandra
